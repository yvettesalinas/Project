# 📛 Project Name and Purpose
Date Destresser 

For this project, we were asked to complete an application that utilized the skills that we learned throughout Modules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (i.e., deployement, interactivity, client-side storage, responsive design, polished UI, etc.).

The Date Destresser is a web application that randomly selects a cocktail and a movie based on the user’s choice of streaming service and genre.

## 💡Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when the webpage is deployed to GitHub Pages. 

* It is done when it is interactive (i.e., accepts and responds to user input).

* It is done when it uses at least two server-side APIs.

* It is done when it uses client-side storage to store persistent data. 

* It is done when it has a polished UI. 

* It is done when it has a quality README (with a unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

* It is done when it has a clean respository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

## 💻 Technologies Used

* Bulma
    - A free and modern CSS framework.
* APIs 
    - Two APIs were incorporated: one for movies and one for cocktails. 
* HTML, CSS and JavaScript
    - We created the skeleton of the webpage using HTML, used CSS to enhance the style, and used JavaScript to make it interactive.
